    Ship takes an x and y for starting position as well as a radius to determine size.
    Initializes heading to point right and dx and dy to zero so it does not move until player input.

    As all collidable objects in this game are circles this function determines if a collision occured 
    by essentially drawing a triangle between the x position and y position of each object and comparing
    the squared difference of each to the hypotenuse.
    Collision occurs when the squared differences are less then the squared radii.

    Updates position with a given dt. If x or y position is above or below certain values, it updates
    the  position to the opposite side of the screen to give the appearence that the ship travels 
    from one side to the other. 
    Keeps heading between certain values by modulo division of 2pi so it cannot shrink or grow endlessly
